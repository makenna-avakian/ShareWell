# Fun learnings and notes:

- Next.js does not support importing tailwind styles through json files like i've done in the past with Vite. The (messy) workaround was to include the classes by full name inside an object literal lookup. Not very pretty, but would be good in a TIL...

- Zustand is REALLY interesting. Much easier than Redux. Went down a rabbit hole: https://makenna-avakian.github.io/TIL/Zustand/zustandStateManagement/

- Next.js v. 13 has a really great way of storing images for production use.
